# Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews Using BERT

## What the Project Does
This project implements sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset using a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The primary goal is to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments, providing insights into audience opinions about films.

## Why the Project is Useful
Understanding sentiment in text data is crucial for various applications, including market research, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis. By leveraging deep learning and natural language processing (NLP), this project demonstrates how advanced models like BERT can effectively analyze and interpret sentiment, offering significant accuracy in classifying opinions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: A deep learning framework for building and training the model.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Library providing pre-trained models and tokenizers for NLP tasks.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library for handling datasets.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Key Features
- **Pre-trained BERT Model**: Utilizes a powerful pre-trained model to enhance sentiment classification accuracy.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of **0.89** and an F1 score of **0.89** on the test dataset.
- **Visualization**: Includes precision-recall curves to evaluate model performance.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple instructions for cloning the repository and running the analysis in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Clear guidance on how to use and contribute to the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB

2. **Install Required Libraries**: 
   Make sure to have Python installed, and then install the necessary packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   *Note: You can also install the required libraries directly in your Google Colab environment.*

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: 
   Open the Jupyter notebook file (e.g., sentiment_analysis.ipynb) in your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, and follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the sentiment analysis.

4. **Results**: 
   After running the notebook, you will see the model's accuracy, which is **0.89**, and the F1 score, also **0.89**, indicating robust performance in sentiment classification.
